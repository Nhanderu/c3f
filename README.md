# Carro Forte

This app idea was my mom's. Briefly, it helps her with some repetitive calculations.

Since I wanted to study React Native and ReasonML, I began this toy project. Two birds with one stone.

## Roadmap

- [x] `v0.1.0`: working version as a React web app
- [ ] `v0.2.0`: working version as a React Native mobile app
- [ ] `v0.3.0`: locally persisting values feature
- [ ] `v1.0.0`: refactor, test, build and ship for both platforms
- [ ] `v1.0.1`: use ReasonML
